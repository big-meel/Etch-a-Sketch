Etch-a-Sketch Web page creates a pixel canvas to draw on by moving the cursor accross the grid.

To erase current grid press the 'New Grid' button above and then select the new resolution of the grid.

 Building from Javascript it was rather difficult to find the proper methods to get all the moving parts of this project to work together. 

 Picked up some new tricks through out this (CSS Grids is now my best friend), and new ways to manipulate Developer Tools (Using Firefox Developer Edition).

 I plan to review this script later on as I'm sure there are betterways to have implemented some of the functions I created and further research will be done.
